# Archive: Old Command-Focused Content

This directory contains the original command-focused learning materials from before the repository was restructured for AI-age learning.

## What's Here

- **topics/** - Original weekly topic-based content organized by command categories
- **exercises/** - Original command-focused exercises organized by week
- **daily-logs/** - Historical daily learning logs

## Why Archive This?

The repository has been restructured from a **command-focused** approach to a **problem-focused** approach that's more effective in the AI age. The old content is preserved here for:

1. **Reference** - You can still look up old notes and examples
2. **History** - Track record of the learning journey
3. **Alternative perspective** - Some learners may prefer the old structure

## Should You Use This Content?

**For new learners**: Start with the new structure in the main repository. This archived content is outdated.

**For existing learners**: You can reference this if you want to review old notes, but focus on the new problem-based structure going forward.

## What Changed?

See [MIGRATION-GUIDE.md](../MIGRATION-GUIDE.md) in the main repository for a complete explanation of:
- What changed and why
- How to transition your existing progress
- Before/after comparisons
- How to use both structures together

## The New Structure

The main repository now focuses on:
- **problems/** - Learn by problem type, not command lists
- **my-knowledge/** - Build your personal problem-solution knowledge base
- **cert-prep/** - Certification-focused recognition practice
- **references/** - Quick lookups organized by problem

This approach emphasizes:
- Understanding what's possible (not memorizing syntax)
- Recognizing patterns (not writing from memory)
- Collaborating with AI (not competing with it)
- Building practical skills (not trivia knowledge)

**Note**: This content is kept for reference only. For active learning, use the new problem-focused structure in the main repository.
