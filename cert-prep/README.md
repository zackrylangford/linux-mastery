# Certification Preparation

This directory contains materials specifically for Linux certification exams (LPIC-1, CompTIA Linux+, etc.).

## What's Different About Cert Prep?

For certification exams, you need to **recognize syntax** even if you wouldn't memorize it for daily work. This directory helps you:

1. **Identify exam-relevant syntax** - What you need to recognize on the exam
2. **Practice recognition** - Exercises to build syntax familiarity
3. **Know what to memorize** - Core concepts vs. syntax you just need to recognize

## Contents

### syntax-to-recognize.md
List of exam-relevant syntax organized by topic. These are marked "recognize, don't memorize" - you need to know what they do when you see them, but you don't need to write them from memory.

### Recognition Practice
Exercises with code snippets and "what does this do?" questions to build your recognition skills.

## Balancing Conceptual Learning with Exam Prep

**For daily work**: Focus on `problems/` directory - learn what's possible and use AI for syntax

**For exam prep**: Use this directory to practice recognizing syntax you'll see on the test

**The key**: You're still learning concepts first, just adding syntax recognition for exam success.
