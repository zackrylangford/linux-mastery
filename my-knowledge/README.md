# My Knowledge Base

**This is YOUR most important directory!** Everything here is personal to you.

## What Goes Here?

This is where you document:
1. **Problems you can solve** - Your growing list of capabilities
2. **AI prompts that work** - Effective prompts you've discovered
3. **Daily learning notes** - Quick logs of what you learned

## The Three Files

### 📋 problems-i-solve.md
Your personal problem-solution map. Every time you learn something new, add it here:
- What problem can you now solve?
- What approach do you use?
- What AI prompt works well?
- When do you use this?

**This becomes your personal reference** - when you face a problem, check here first!

### 💡 good-prompts.md
Collection of AI prompts that worked well for you. Organized by problem type.

When you find a prompt that gives you exactly what you need, save it here. Over time, you'll build a library of effective prompts.

### 📝 daily-log.md
Quick daily notes - keep it under 5 minutes!

Just jot down:
- What problem did you learn about today?
- What worked?
- What do you want to try next?

**No pressure** - this is just to help you remember your progress.

## How to Use This

**After each learning session:**
1. Add the problem to `problems-i-solve.md`
2. Save any good AI prompts to `good-prompts.md`
3. Quick note in `daily-log.md` (optional)

**When facing a new problem:**
1. Check `problems-i-solve.md` - have you solved something similar?
2. Check `good-prompts.md` - do you have a prompt template?
3. If not, learn it and add it!

## Why This Matters

Traditional learning focuses on "what did I study?" This focuses on **"what can I do?"**

Your knowledge base grows with every problem you solve. Over time, you'll have a personalized reference that's more useful than any generic tutorial.
