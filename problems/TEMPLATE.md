## Try it yourself

**Practice with AI:**
1. Think of a specific version of this problem you want to solve
2. Use one of the AI prompt templates above
3. Ask AI to generate the solution
4. **Before running it:** Try to understand what the AI gave you
5. Run it and verify it works
6. Document what you learned in `my-knowledge/problems-i-solve.md`

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] Does the solution match what you asked for?
- [ ] Can you explain what each part does?
- [ ] Did you test it safely (won't delete/break things)?
- [ ] Do you understand when to use this approach?

## What to memorize vs look up

**Memorize (high-value knowledge):**
- [Concept 1: The mental model or key idea]
- [Concept 2: When to use which tool]
- [Concept 3: Tool names and what they do]

**Look up as needed (low-value to memorize):**
- [Specific flags and syntax]
- [Exact command options]
- [Complex combinations]

## For certification prep

**LPIC-1 / CompTIA Linux+ relevant syntax to recognize:**
- `[syntax pattern 1]` - [what it does]
- `[syntax pattern 2]` - [what it does]
- `[syntax pattern 3]` - [what it does]

*Note: You don't need to memorize these, but you should be able to recognize what they do when you see them on an exam.*
